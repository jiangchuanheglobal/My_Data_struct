data structure implementation
==============================

primitive
-----------------------------
Actually, array and linked structure are the foundation of all
kinds of high level data structures. High level structure can be built
using array and linked structures in three ways, they are

1. only using array
2. only using linked structure
3. hybrid using of array and linked structure

note: some data structures can only be built based on only one of them, which means
      this particular data structure cannot choose all of them at will.

basic
--------------------------

1. stack
2. link
3. queue

### circular array implementation ###

4. tree

advanced
--------------------------

1. heap
